# BudgetCheck

This was an assignment from my class: programming and problem solving I. 

The original assignment was to create a retirement portfolio but since I'm not retiring anytime soon, 
I asked my professor if I can do my own idea for this financial project. He graciously obliged and allowed me
to make a budgeting program instead.

I want it to be known that I made this project prior to learning about ADT's. I also did not know of 
this rule: "Never #include cpp files! Only include headers". This was my very first "big" project. 
I admit, it's naively made but it works!

The user has the option to load financial information from their previous visit (this is the first 
question presented to the user). The financial information is saved in multiple files. If the user chooses to,
he or she can decline to load information from their previous visit and answer questions anew. The new responses will
be saved for the next visit. The user has to enter their income amount and the frequency of that 
income (whether it is daily, weekly, or monthly). Then they have to enter their outgo amount and the frequency
of those outgoes (whether it is daily, weekly, or monthly). Once user is done entering all their information they 
can close out of the program. A column graph will present itself and show the comparison between
the reality of the user's expendatures verses the ideal.
